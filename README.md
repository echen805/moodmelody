## Technical Overview

### Architecture

MoodMelody v2 follows a modular Swift Package Manager architecture with clear separation of concerns:

```
MoodMelody v2/
â”œâ”€â”€ moodmelodyv2/           # Main iOS app target
â”œâ”€â”€ MoodCore/               # Core business logic and models
â”œâ”€â”€ AppleMusicClient/       # Apple Music API integration
â””â”€â”€ UIComponents/           # Reusable UI components
```

### Swift Packages

#### 1. **MoodCore** 
Core business logic and shared models used across the application.

**Key Components:**
- `Track.swift` - Core track model with metadata and like functionality
- `MoodType.swift` - Enum defining the four mood categories with search terms and visual styling
- `MoodCache.swift` - Persistent caching layer using UserDefaults with 24-hour expiration

#### 2. **AppleMusicClient**
Handles all Apple Music API interactions and audio playback.

**Key Components:**
- `AppleMusicSearch.swift` - Manages MusicKit catalog search requests
- `AppleMusicPlayback.swift` - AVFoundation-based preview playback system
- `AppleMusicAuth.swift` - Apple Music authorization management

#### 3. **UIComponents**
Reusable SwiftUI components for consistent UI across the app.

**Key Components:**
- `TrackCard.swift` - Individual track display with playback and like controls
- `MoodButton.swift` - Mood selection buttons with emoji and color theming
- `PlaybackBar.swift` - Mini-player showing current track with basic controls

### Core Features Deep Dive

#### Mood System
The app centers around four predefined moods, each with:
- **Visual Identity**: Unique emoji and color scheme
- **Search Strategy**: Tailored Apple Music search terms
- **Persistent State**: Separate like lists and cache storage

```swift
public enum MoodType: String, CaseIterable {
    case happy = "Happy"        // ðŸ˜Š Yellow
    case sad = "Sad"           // ðŸ˜¢ Blue  
    case angry = "Angry"       // ðŸ˜¡ Red
    case frustrated = "Frustrated" // ðŸ˜¤ Orange
}
```

#### Smart Caching Strategy
- **24-Hour Expiration**: Balances fresh content with performance
- **Mood-Specific Storage**: Separate cache buckets for each mood
- **Like State Persistence**: User preferences survive app restarts
- **Graceful Fallback**: Falls back to live search when cache expires

#### Apple Music Integration
- **MusicKit Framework**: Official Apple Music API integration
- **Catalog Search**: Searches Apple Music's full catalog based on mood
- **Preview Playback**: 30-second track previews via AVFoundation
- **Authorization Flow**: Handles Music app permissions and restrictions

### App Flow

1. **Launch**: Check onboarding completion status
2. **Onboarding**: Request Apple Music authorization if needed
3. **Mood Selection**: Present four mood options in a grid layout
4. **Track Discovery**: Search Apple Music catalog (cached or live)
5. **Playback**: Preview tracks with playback controls
6. **Personalization**: Like tracks to build mood-specific collections

### Technical Requirements

- **iOS 15.0+**: Minimum deployment target
- **Swift 5.9+**: Swift tools version
- **MusicKit**: Apple Music integration
- **AVFoundation**: Audio playback capabilities
- **Apple Music Subscription**: Required for full functionality

### Project Configuration

#### Info.plist Permissions
```xml
<key>NSAppleMusicUsageDescription</key>
<string>MoodMelody needs access to Apple Music to provide personalized music recommendations based on your mood.</string>

<key>UIBackgroundModes</key>
<array>
    <string>audio</string>
</array>
```

#### Entitlements
- `com.apple.developer.musickitidentifiers`: Apple Music catalog access
- `com.apple.developer.playable-content`: Background audio playback

### State Management

The app uses a combination of:
- **@StateObject/@ObservableObject**: For reactive UI updates
- **@AppStorage**: For simple persistent settings (onboarding status)
- **UserDefaults**: For complex cached data (tracks, likes)
- **Singleton Pattern**: For shared services (search, playback, cache)

### Testing Structure

- **Unit Tests**: `moodmelodyv2Tests/` - Business logic testing
- **UI Tests**: `moodmelodyv2UITests/` - End-to-end user interaction testing
- **XCTest Framework**: Standard iOS testing with XCTAssert functions

### Key Dependencies

- **MusicKit**: Apple's official framework for Apple Music integration
- **AVFoundation**: Audio session management and playback
- **SwiftUI**: Modern declarative UI framework
- **Foundation**: Core Swift framework for data handling

### Performance Considerations

- **Lazy Loading**: Track lists use LazyVStack for efficient memory usage
- **Image Caching**: AsyncImage handles artwork loading and caching
- **Search Debouncing**: Prevents excessive API calls during user interaction
- **Background Audio**: Continues playback when app is backgrounded

### Future Enhancement Opportunities

- **Machine Learning**: Improve mood-based recommendations over time
- **Social Features**: Share mood playlists with friends
- **Custom Moods**: Allow users to create custom mood categories
- **Analytics**: Track user preferences for better recommendations
- **Offline Mode**: Download tracks for offline listening
- **Cross-Platform**: Expand to macOS, watchOS, or tvOS
